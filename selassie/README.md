## Team Selassie

[Emperor Haile Selassie I](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Haile_Selassie), born Tafari Makonnen, he was the Emperor of Ethiopia and a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history. Emperor Selassie sought to modernize the country through a series of political and social reforms. He introduced Ethiopia's written constitution in 1931 and abolished slavery. Emperor Selassie was very committed to education. He visited many schools throughout Ethiopia, encouraging students to learn and sometimes giving them financial incentives, sweaters, and so on. Emperor Selassie was also criticized by human rights groups for being autocratic and illiberal, but many Ethiopians consider him one of Ethiopia's best leaders. This team was named in honor of Emperor Selassie, and his contribution to modernizing Ethiopia.
