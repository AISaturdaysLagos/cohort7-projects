## Team Sankara
[President Thomas Isidore NoÃ«l Sankara](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thomas_Sankara) was the first president of Burkina Faso, Burkinabe military officer, Marxist revolutionary and Pan-Africanist. President Sankara's domestic policies focused on preventing famine through agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, promoting education through a nationwide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating more than 2 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles, which saved the lives of 18,000 to 50,000 children annually. President Sankara's government focused on building schools, health centers, water reservoirs, and a nearly 100-kilometer railroad, with little or no outside help. Under President Sankara's leadership, female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy were banned and women were appointed to high government positions, encouraged to work outside the home and attend school even if they were pregnant. President Sankara is a hero to us all and this team was named after him to commemorate his contribution to a better world.
