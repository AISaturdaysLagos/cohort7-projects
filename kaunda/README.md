## Team Kaunda
President Kenneth David Kaunda was the first president of Zambia. President Kaunda introduced a policy whereby all children, regardless of their parents' ability to pay, received free exercise books, pens and pencils. This team was named to honor and commemorate President Kaunda's contribution to a better world.

## Project 
Team Kaunda's project aims to help rent seekers predict the price of an apartment and thus budget correctly. Relocating can be costly, and often the goal is to get value for the money invested. With the rent prediction app, apartment seekers can accurately analyze the cost of an apartment or house in Nigeria.
